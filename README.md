- Engineer features and build predictive models for loan default risk.

## Data Requirements
- Input file: `crossriver.csv` containing borrower demographics, loan details, and default status.

## Execution Instructions
1. Place `crossriver.csv` in the project directory or adjust the path in `ds_crossriver.ipynb`.
2. Open and run `ds_crossriver.ipynb` sequentially. The notebook is organized into sections for data loading, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.
